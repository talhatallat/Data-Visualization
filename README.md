# Project description
The Data Visualization project generates data and creates a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using matplotlib and Pygal.

-  Access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a world population map.

-  Write a program to automatically download and visualize data.

Data visualization involves exploring data through visual representations. Itâ€™s closely associated with data mining, which uses code to explore the patterns and connections in a data set. A data set can be just a small list of numbers that fits in one line of code or many gigabytes of data.


People use Python for data-intensive work in genetics, climate research, political and economic analysis, and much more.

-  matplotlib to make simple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots.
-  Pygal, focuses on creating visualizations that work well on digital devices. Pygal to emphasize and resize elements as the user interacts with your visualization, and you can easily resize the entire representation to fit on a tiny smartwatch or giant monitor. Use Pygal to explore what happens when you roll dice in various ways.
